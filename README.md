# simple2d
"simple" 2D render engine written in python with using the lowest possible amount of library imports.

## You want low Performance and many bugs?
## Then this is THE best render engine for you!

## why is it so slow?
everything (for example lines) get calculated with algorithms (except images) and then stored in a matrix list. Then currently they get drawn pixel by pixel.

## will it get faster in the future?
yes.
it will get a complex async rendering system.
So in future we hope to get 10x the performance!

## why does this exist?
wanted a challenge

## why in python?
becouse i want to get better in python

## who is this engine for?
it targets everyone that wants to do something (like a programm or a small game) without easy-to-use libraries

## does it have something to do with SimpleScriptLanguage?
Not YET!
SSL will get this library implemented in the future
